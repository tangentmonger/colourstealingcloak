_Alice, wearing the cloak (which is twinkling white)_

_Bob, wearing a blue hat_

Alice, looking at Bob's hat: “Oh, I like your hat! It’s a lovely shade of blue!”

Bob: "Oh, thank you!"

Alice, looking Bob straight in the eye: “Such a lovely colour! _I’m going to steal your colour!!!_”

Bob: "???!!"

_Alice touches Bob's hat and presses the 'sense' button with her thumb. The cloak changes colour to match Bob's hat_

_Bob's mind is blown_
