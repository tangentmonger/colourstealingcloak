The Colour Stealing Cloak
=========================

An interactive, wearable art project.

Components

* A glove, with a colour sensor on the index finger and two buttons on the middle finger
* A large battery on a shoulder strap
* An Arduino Nano

Script
------

Alice, wearing the cloak (which is twinkling white)
Bob, wearing a blue hat

Alice, looking at Bob's hat: “Oh, I like your hat! It’s a lovely shade of blue!”
Bob: "Oh, thank you!"
Alice, looking Bob straight in the eye: “Such a lovely colour! I’m going to steal your colour!!!”
Bob: "???!!"
*Alice points to Bob's hat and presses the 'sense' button with her thumb. The cloak changes colour to match Bob's hat
Bob: <mind blown>
